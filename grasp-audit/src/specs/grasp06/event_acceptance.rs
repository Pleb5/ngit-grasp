//! GRASP-06 event-acceptance relaxation tests
//!
//! Spec: <https://github.com/DanConwayDev/grasp/blob/main/06.md>
//!
//! Covers 06.md lines 21–24: PR and PR Update events that would otherwise be
//! rejected under GRASP-01 for not referencing an accepted repository
//! announcement MUST instead be accepted, provided the event:
//!
//! 1. has an `a` tag of the form `30617:<pubkey>:<identifier>`, AND
//! 2. has a `clone` tag naming this service's
//!    `/prs/<signer-npub>/<identifier>.git` endpoint.
//!
//! Both tests build kind-1618 PR events for a coord this relay has **no
//! accepted announcement** for. The only difference between them is the
//! `clone` tag: test 5 names this relay's `/prs/` endpoint (expected to be
//! accepted under the relaxation), test 6 names a different host (expected
//! to remain rejected).
//!
//! ## Why kind 1618 only
//!
//! The spec treats PRs (kind 1618) and PR Updates (kind 1619) identically.
//! rust-nostr already handles kind discrimination; covering 1619 separately
//! would only test that we typed the same number twice. Skipping it.
