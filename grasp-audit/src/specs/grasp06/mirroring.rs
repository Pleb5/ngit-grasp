//! GRASP-06 cross-service mirror tests
//!
//! Spec source: design doc at
//! `docs/explanation/grasp-06-contributor-pr-submission.md`, "Cross-service
//! mirror" section. The contract is derived from the design — the 06.md spec
//! itself does not name this behaviour — but the design decision is settled
//! and the tests below pin it down so a regression would be visible.
//!
//! Two tests, complementary directions:
//!
//! - [`MirroringTests::test_prs_push_mirrors_to_announced_repo`]
//!   A `refs/nostr/<event-id>` push received at `/prs/<contributor>/<id>.git`,
//!   when paired with a PR event whose `a` tag references an accepted
//!   announcement on this relay, MUST appear at the announced repo too. The
//!   announced repo is the natural location for clients browsing the project.
//!
//! - [`MirroringTests::test_standard_push_does_not_mirror_to_prs`]
//!   The reverse direction MUST NOT mirror: a push to the standard
//!   `/<npub>/<id>.git` endpoint must not appear under `/prs/`. The /prs/
//!   namespace is a contributor-submission side-channel; conflating
//!   maintainer pushes into it would invent hosting locations the maintainer
//!   never declared.
//!
//! ## Fixture reuse
//!
//! Test 7 reuses [`FixtureKind::ValidRepoServed`] (which transitively triggers
//! `OwnerStateDataPushed` — see `src/fixtures.rs` deps map) to obtain an
//! accepted, served repo announcement to mirror INTO. Test 8 reuses
//! [`FixtureKind::PREvent2Served`] which already pushes a PR ref to the
//! standard endpoint; that is exactly the "push to standard, assert absent
//! from /prs/" precondition for the reverse-mirror check.
//!
//! ## Timing
//!
//! Mirroring is kicked off asynchronously from
//! `process_newly_available_git_data` after the /prs/ receive-pack completes.
//! The same receive-pack also releases the PR event from purgatory, so two
//! observable post-conditions follow the push:
//!
//! 1. The PR event becomes queryable (purgatory → served).
//! 2. The mirrored ref + objects appear at the announced repo.
//!
//! We sanity-check (1) first — if the event is never released, asserting
//! (2) is meaningless and would surface as a confusing "ref not found"
//! instead of the true root cause. The pattern mirrors the existing
//! fixtures (short fixed sleep + single `is_event_on_relay` check, e.g.
//! [`FixturesContext::build_pr_event_2_served`]). Then a second fixed
//! sleep before the ref-mirror probe — keeps the total wait close to
//! the original 2 s while making the two failure modes attributable.

    ///
    /// ## Setup
    ///
    /// 1. Ensure an accepted, served announcement at `<owner-npub>/<repo-id>.git`
    ///    via `FixtureKind::ValidRepoServed` (transitively pushes owner git data).
    /// 2. Materialise a throwaway commit locally and capture its hash. We
    ///    intentionally do NOT depend on the deterministic-commit helper
    ///    here — the spec contract is "c tag equals pushed commit", not
    ///    "commit equals some constant". Tying the test to
    ///    `PR_TEST_COMMIT_HASH` would couple it to commit-machinery
    ///    invariants this test doesn't care about; any hash will do as long
    ///    as we use the same one in both places.
    /// 3. Build a kind-1618 PR event signed by `pr_author_keys`:
    ///    - `a` tag references the owner's coord (`30617:<owner-hex>:<repo-id>`).
    ///    - `c` tag = the hash from step 2.
    ///    - `clone` tag = this relay's `/prs/<pr-author-npub>/<repo-id>.git`.
    /// 4. Publish the PR event. Acceptance via the standard GRASP-01 path is
    ///    expected (the coord IS announced); purgatory is fine too — the spec
    ///    contract under test is the mirror, not the acceptance path.
    /// 5. Push `HEAD:refs/nostr/<pr-event-id>` from the local repo to the
    ///    /prs/ URL.
    /// 6. Short wait, then verify the PR event has been released from
    ///    purgatory via `is_event_on_relay`. The same receive-pack that
    ///    triggers the mirror also releases the event, so this is the
    ///    first observable post-condition and the cleanest gate before
    ///    asserting the mirror itself. Pattern matches existing fixtures
    ///    (e.g. `build_pr_event_2_served`).
    /// 7. Short wait, then fetch `refs/nostr/<pr-event-id>` from the
    ///    standard `<owner>/<repo-id>.git` URL.
    /// 8. Verify the mirror: `git cat-file -e` on the expected commit hash
    ///    plus a `rev-parse` cross-check — proves both that the ref is
    ///    present AND that its commit object is reachable (the user's
    ///    verification choice — "clone the maintainer repo and verify
    ///    commit reachable").
