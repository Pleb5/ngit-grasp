//! GRASP-06 specification tests
//!
//! Spec: <https://github.com/DanConwayDev/grasp/blob/main/06.md>
//!
//! ## Test Suites
//!
//! - [`PrsEndpointTests`] - `/prs/<npub>/<id>.git` endpoint behaviour
//!   (discovery gate, empty-repo fetch, push acceptance/rejection)
//! - [`Nip11Tests`] - NIP-11 advertisement of GRASP-06 capability
//! - [`EventAcceptanceTests`] - PR/PR-Update event-acceptance relaxation
//!   (06.md lines 21–24)
//! - [`MirroringTests`] - cross-service mirror: `/prs/` → announced repo
//!   (forward), and announced repo ↛ `/prs/` (reverse must not fire).
//!   Design-doc derived.
//!
//! ## Shared fixtures
//!
//! [`fixtures`] holds non-Event prerequisites shared across the suite
//! (currently the NIP-11 document). New checks needing the doc should reuse
//! [`fixtures::advertises_grasp`] rather than re-fetching.
//!
//! ## Suite-level orchestration: [`Grasp06Tests`]
//!
//! Use [`Grasp06Tests::run_all`] to run the full GRASP-06 suite. It
//! transparently handles the NIP-11 discovery gate:
//!
//! - The "off-contract" discovery gate test always runs.
//! - If NIP-11 advertises `GRASP-06`, the "on-contract" tests run normally.
//! - If NIP-11 does not advertise it (or the NIP-11 fetch fails), the
//!   on-contract tests are emitted as **skipped** results — visible in the
//!   audit report in grey, with a reason — so the suite never accidentally
//!   reports a red failure for a feature the relay never claimed to support.
//!
//! [`Grasp06Tests::print_report`] renders the GRASP-06-specific report block.
//! The CLI prints it separately from the GRASP-01 block (when running
//! `--spec all`), so each spec family gets its own header and section walk.
