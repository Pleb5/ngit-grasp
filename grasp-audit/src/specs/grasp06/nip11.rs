//! GRASP-06 NIP-11 advertisement tests
//!
//! Spec: <https://github.com/DanConwayDev/grasp/blob/main/06.md>
//!
//! These tests cover the discovery-gate contract from the "on" side: when
//! the relay opts into GRASP-06, its NIP-11 document MUST advertise the
//! capability so clients can find it.
//!
//! The complementary "off" side (no advertisement => /prs/ MUST 404) lives
//! in [`super::prs_endpoint`].

    /// must move in lockstep.
    ///
    /// Note: this test is only meaningful when run against a relay that has
    /// the feature enabled. It is therefore wired only into the
    /// `isolated_test_with_grasp_06!` harness. Pre-implementation it WILL
    /// fail (TDD red); once Phase 9 lands it becomes the regression guard.
