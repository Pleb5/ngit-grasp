//! Relay Health Tracking for GRASP-02 Proactive Sync
//!
//! This module implements health tracking for relay connections, including:
//! - Health state machine (Healthy -> Degraded -> Dead -> RateLimited)
//! - Exponential backoff with configurable max delay
//! - Dead relay detection after 24h of continuous failures
//! - Rate limit detection and fixed cooldown period
//!
//! ## Health States
//!
//! - **Healthy**: Working connection, no recent failures
//! - **Degraded**: Connection failed, retrying with backoff
//! - **Dead**: 24h+ of continuous failures, minimal retry (once per day)
//! - **RateLimited**: NOTICE-triggered 65-second cooldown to avoid rate limits
