//! Relay Connection Management for Proactive Sync
//!
//! This module provides relay connection management for external relay connections.
//! Each RelayConnection manages a single connection to an external relay and handles
//! subscriptions using the three-layer sync strategy.
//!
//! ## NIP-77 Negentropy Support
//!
//! RelayConnection supports NIP-77 negentropy for efficient set reconciliation:
//! - `supports_negentropy()` - Check if remote relay supports NIP-77
//! - `negentropy_sync_filter()` - Perform negentropy sync for a filter
//!
//! When NIP-77 is supported, historical sync uses negentropy instead of REQ+EOSE,
//! significantly reducing bandwidth for relays with overlapping event sets.
//!
//! See `docs/explanation/grasp-02-proactive-sync.md` for full design details.

/// - Event notification loop
/// - NIP-77 negentropy synchronization

/// # Why Client instead of Relay directly?
///
/// While it would be cleaner to hold a `Relay` directly (since we only manage
/// one relay per connection), the nostr-sdk API makes `Relay::new()` private
/// (`pub(crate)`). Relays can only be created through `Client::add_relay()` or
/// `RelayPool::add_relay()`. This is an intentional design in nostr-sdk to
/// ensure proper lifecycle management.
///
/// The Client adds minimal overhead since we configure it with a single relay,
/// and we retrieve the `Relay` reference for notification handling.
