//! Purgatory: In-memory holding area for events awaiting git data.
//!
//! Solves the "which arrives first?" problem where either nostr events or git pushes
//! can arrive in any order. Events and git data are held temporarily until their
//! counterpart arrives, at which point they can be processed together.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - **In-memory only**: Data is lost on restart (acceptable per spec)
//! - **Thread-safe**: Uses DashMap for concurrent access from multiple handlers
//! - **Automatic expiry**: Entries expire after 30 minutes by default
//! - **Separate stores**: State events and PR events use different indexing strategies
