## What Is Explanation?

Explanation documentation helps you **understand concepts** and design decisions, providing context and discussing alternatives.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Understanding-oriented (clarify concepts)
- ✅ Theoretical (ideas and design)
- ✅ Discuss alternatives
- ✅ Provide context and background
- ✅ Answer "why" questions

**Not explanation:**
- ❌ Step-by-step lessons (those are Tutorials)
- ❌ Problem-solving recipes (those are How-To)
- ❌ Technical specifications (those are Reference)
