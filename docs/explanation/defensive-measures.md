# Defensive Measures & Rate Limiting

This document describes the defensive measures implemented in ngit-grasp to protect against abuse, spam, and denial-of-service attacks.

**Note:** A point-in-time analysis of defensive measures in other Nostr relays (strfry, nostr-rs-relay, khatru) was conducted to inform these design decisions. The analysis examined connection limits, rate limiting approaches, and per-IP enforcement strategies across the ecosystem.

## Overview

ngit-grasp employs multiple layers of defense:

1. **Connection & Subscription Limits** - Per-connection limits on subscriptions and event publishing
2. **Content Filtering** - Blacklist/whitelist system for repositories and event authors
3. **Event Validation** - Strict GRASP-01 protocol validation
4. **Relay Health Management** - Intelligent handling of problematic remote relays

## What's Implemented

### Per-Connection Rate Limits

**Source:** Built-in to rust-nostr relay-builder

- **Subscription limit:** Max 500 concurrent subscriptions per connection
- **Event publishing limit:** Max 60 events per minute per connection
- **Subscription ID length:** Max 250 characters
- **Filter limit:** Max 500 results per query (default)

These limits prevent individual connections from overwhelming the relay.

### Per-IP Connection Monitoring

**Source:** Custom ngit-grasp implementation  
**Location:** `src/metrics/connection.rs`

- **Status:** Monitoring only (does NOT enforce limits)
- Tracks connections per IP address internally
- Flags IPs exceeding threshold (default: 10 connections)
- **Privacy:** IP addresses never exposed in Prometheus metrics, only aggregate counts
- Logs warnings when threshold exceeded

**Note on enforcement:** Per-IP connection limits are not built into rust-nostr relay-builder (tracks per WebSocket connection, not per IP). If abuse is detected via metrics, enforcement should be implemented as a PR to rust-nostr/relay-builder to benefit the entire Nostr ecosystem, rather than custom code in ngit-grasp.

### Content Filtering (Blacklists/Whitelists)

**Source:** Custom ngit-grasp implementation  
**Location:** `src/config.rs`, `src/nostr/builder.rs`

**Event Blacklist:**
- Block ALL events from specific authors (npubs)
- Takes precedence over all other validation
- Events never reach storage or purgatory

**Repository Blacklist:**
- Block specific repositories, developers, or identifiers
- Takes precedence over whitelists
- Three formats: `npub`, `npub/identifier`, `identifier`

**Repository Whitelist:**
- Curate which repositories are accepted (GRASP-01 mode)
- Only accept announcements that both list your service AND match whitelist
- Same three formats as blacklist

**Archive Whitelist (GRASP-05):**
- Mirror specific repositories even if they don't list your service
- Same three formats as blacklist
- Default: read-only mode when enabled

**Privacy:** Blacklists not advertised in NIP-11 metadata.

### Event Validation Plugin System

**Source:** Built-in to rust-nostr relay-builder  
**Implementation:** Custom GRASP-01 validation in `src/nostr/builder.rs`

- **WritePolicy trait:** Controls which events are accepted
- **QueryPolicy trait:** Controls which queries are allowed (not currently used)
- Access to client IP address for future per-IP rate limiting
- Modular sub-policies for different event types (announcements, state events, PRs)

### Relay Health Management (GRASP-02 Sync)

**Source:** Custom ngit-grasp implementation  
**Location:** `src/sync/health.rs`

**Exponential Backoff:**
- Failed connections trigger increasing delays: 5s → 10s → 20s → ... → 1 hour max
- Prevents hammering dead or slow relays

**Naughty List:**
- Tracks relays with persistent infrastructure issues (DNS, TLS, protocol errors)
- Separate from normal connection failures
- 12-hour expiration (configurable)
- Reduces retry frequency for broken relays

**Rate Limit Detection:**
- Detects when remote relay rate limits us
- Automatic 65-second cooldown
- Prevents hammering relays that tell us to slow down

**Domain Throttling (Git Data Fetching):**
- Max 5 concurrent requests per domain
- Max 30 requests per minute per domain
- Respectful rate limiting when fetching missing git data

## What's NOT Implemented

### Per-IP Rate Limiting

- **Per-IP connection limits:** Not enforced (only monitored)
- **Per-IP subscription limits:** Not supported
- **Per-IP event publishing limits:** Not supported

**Why:** rust-nostr relay-builder tracks limits per WebSocket connection, not per IP address.

**To implement:** Would require custom middleware/WritePolicy to aggregate across connections from the same IP.

### Query Filtering

**Status:** QueryPolicy trait available but not currently used.

**Potential uses:** Rate limit queries per IP, block expensive queries, restrict access to certain event kinds.

## Future Enhancements

### Per-IP Rate Limiting

Per-IP connection and event rate limiting were considered but deferred until abuse is detected in production. The current protections (per-connection limits, total connection limit, content filtering) are sufficient for the git relay use case.

**Decision rationale:** The primary DoS vector is connection exhaustion, which is addressed by the total connection limit (`NGIT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`). Per-IP enforcement would require custom middleware in rust-nostr relay-builder (which currently tracks limits per WebSocket connection, not per IP). If abuse is detected via the per-IP monitoring metrics, enforcement should be implemented as a PR to rust-nostr/relay-builder to benefit the entire Nostr ecosystem.

**Related:** Git endpoint throttling (issue ff38) is a separate concern with different requirements.
