# How to enable GRASP-06 contributor PR submission

GRASP-06 adds an opt-in endpoint at `/prs/<npub>/<identifier>.git` that any contributor can push PR (kind 1618) and PR Update (kind 1619) `refs/nostr/<event-id>` refs to, even when this relay has no accepted announcement for the target repository. The endpoint is unauthenticated at the HTTP level — validity is established by the signed PR event.

This page covers the operator-facing steps to turn it on and verify it.

## 1. Flip the feature flag

Set `NGIT_GRASP06_ENABLE=true` for the relay process. The flag is off by default; everything below is a no-op without it.

**Environment file** (`.env`):

```env
NGIT_GRASP06_ENABLE=true
```

**CLI flag**:

```bash
ngit-grasp --grasp06-enable ...
```

**NixOS module**:

```nix
services.ngit-grasp.instances.<name>.grasp06Enable = true;
```

Restart the relay after the change.

## 2. Verify NIP-11 advertises GRASP-06

NIP-11 is served from `/` with the `Accept: application/nostr+json` header:

```bash
curl -s -H 'Accept: application/nostr+json' https://your-relay.example/ | jq '.supported_grasps'
```

The output must include `"GRASP-06"`. If it does not, the flag did not take effect — re-check the env var name and that the relay actually restarted.

## 3. Verify `/prs/` is reachable

Pick any well-formed npub and any identifier. A non-existent contributor + repo combination is fine — the endpoint synthesises an empty bare repo for fetches against paths that don't yet exist:

```bash
git clone https://your-relay.example/prs/npub1.../any-identifier.git /tmp/probe
```

You should get a successful clone of an empty repository (zero refs). No directory is created on the server for this probe.

To verify a contributor push round-trip, publish a kind 1618 PR event whose `clone` tag names this relay's `/prs/<signer-npub>/<d>.git` URL, then:

```bash
git push https://your-relay.example/prs/<signer-npub>/<d>.git \
    <commit-sha>:refs/nostr/<event-id>
```

The push succeeds, the relay creates `<git_data_path>/prs/<signer-hex>/<d>.git` on demand, and the ref is locked into the repo. Pushes to anything other than `refs/nostr/<64-lowercase-hex>` are rejected with an `ERR` pkt-line.

## Storage cost

One bare repo per `(submitter, identifier)` combination under `<git_data_path>/prs/<submitter-hex>/<identifier>.git`. Repos are garbage-collected inline at the three sites that can leave one empty — there is no separate periodic sweep over `<git_data_path>/prs/`:

- After receive-pack, the repo is removed immediately if it has zero refs left (probe pushes that produced no valid state).
- When a PR event arrives that fails validation against a scoped `/prs/` placeholder, the corresponding `refs/nostr/<event-id>` ref is deleted; if that leaves the repo with zero refs the directory is removed in the same step.
- When a scoped placeholder expires from purgatory without a matching PR event (default 30 minutes), the standard purgatory sweep deletes the dangling ref and, if it leaves the repo zero-ref, the bare repo itself.

All three sites share the same per-`(submitter, identifier)` mutex so they cannot race with an in-flight push.

There is no quota in this release. Disk consumption is bounded only by the rate at which contributors push valid PR refs.

## Abuse controls

The current release relies entirely on:

- the signed PR / PR Update event (no NIP-98 or other HTTP auth on push),
- the requirement that the event's `clone` tag names this relay's `/prs/<signer>/<d>.git` endpoint,
- the standard 30-minute purgatory TTL, and
- the inline zero-ref cleanups described under "Storage cost".

The following knobs are **future** additions and are not yet wired:

- per-submitter allowlist,
- per-submitter or per-event disk quotas,
- per-ref pack size cap,
- NIP-98 authenticated push,
- PoW gating.

If you need any of these today, leave `NGIT_GRASP06_ENABLE=false`.
