//! NIP-77 Negentropy Sync Smoke Tests
//!
//! Verifies that ngit-grasp's NIP-77 claim is valid by testing negentropy
//! reconciliation between a client and the relay.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! NIP-77 defines the negentropy protocol for efficient set reconciliation.
//! The nostr-relay-builder v0.44 provides built-in NIP-77 support via:
//! - NEG-OPEN message handling
//! - NEG-MSG message handling
//! - NEG-CLOSE message handling
//!
//! This test uses nostr-sdk's `client.sync()` method to perform negentropy
//! reconciliation against the relay.
//!
//! # Running Tests
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --test nip77_negentropy -- --nocapture
//! ```

/// Scenario:
/// 1. Start a TestRelay
/// 2. Publish a couple of events to it
/// 3. Create a fresh client with empty local database
/// 4. Call client.sync() to perform negentropy reconciliation
/// 5. Verify reconciliation found the events on the relay
///
/// Uses kind 10317 (GitUserGraspList) events which are unconditionally accepted
/// by the relay without requiring a promoted repository. This avoids the
/// announcements-purgatory system which holds kind 30617 events until git data
/// arrives, meaning announcement events are not stored in the DB and would not
/// appear in negentropy sync results.
