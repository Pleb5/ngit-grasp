//! Historic Sync Tests
//!
//! Tests for relay synchronization from a pre-configured bootstrap relay.
//! These tests verify that a relay can sync events from another relay
//! that it's configured to connect to on startup.
//!
//! "Historic sync" refers to events that existed on the source relay BEFORE
//! the syncing relay connected (bootstrap scenario).
